                                             run this command in command prompt
                                            
                                            
                                             . . .pip install flask
   4.  Open Command Prompt of Anaconda called as Anaconda Prompt (as most of the dependencies are pre-installed).
   5.  Now change the path of working directory to that of extracted repo (that is, ..\Image-Security-master)
   6.  When the path of working directory is same as that of the extracted run these commands in anaconda prompt:-
  
   
                                             . . .flask
                                             . . .python runserver.py
   7.  This will start your local sever, the server address will be displayed in the command prompt of anaconda.
       The server address will be http://localhost:5555/ in most cases.
   8.  In your browser open the sever address.
   9.  Upload any image to the encryption tab, it will generate encrypted image file along with the key to decrypt it.
   10. Upload the encrypted image along with the correct key to the decryption tab to download the decrypted image.
